# Task

## Unit Tests

Create a set of unit tests to cover all the S3 module.

## Integration Tests

Create two integration tests: one to check the `download_file` function and another one to check the `download_files` function.

We have uploaded two files to S3 that you can use in your integration tests:

```
s3://pythontesting-beeva/test.txt
s3://pythontesting-beeva/test2.txt
```

The content of these files is the same than the files you can find under the `resources` folder.
